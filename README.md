"Titanic..!"

Not just a movie 🎬 and no one (like really "no one") is working in Data science and does not know what that word means or indicates!

It has a special positioning in DS. It's often your or somebody else's kick-off in the field ⚽️

After being away far from the Titanic dataset, been working on other projects, I finally decided to do it again " … yet this time should be different" I said to myself 😄

But HOW different could it be if it's compared to all those people who really did great jobs analyzing Titanic?

Ok! let me tell you a bit about myself .. I love stories ✔️ and am a question-oriented guy ✔️ who always likes to ask .. like ask a lot!

And the bad thing is (not sure good or bad) that I tend to sub-questionize my question (Mitosis) till I get it down to a really interesting question that would provide me "OK, Buddy, we got it!" to stop asking and start seeking an answer.

Enough talking … .

🔹 Here's my DIFFERENT treat to the Titanic dataset.

After playing around with all the features I came up with the following question:

🔶 Could a Ticket Decide Your Destiny? Buy yours Now! 🔶

Not only I try to answer this question in this KaggleBook 📊 but also I've created an engaging Experience 💪 It's a Simulating Web App to **storytelling *my findings (This is my big deal*)

✅ So it's Titanic like you never saw before .. Check out the NoteBook

✅ You can always set yourself for a voyage and buy yourself a ticket through this Website

I'd like to ask you all for your sincere feedback/opinion on that project and if there are any suggestions to improve the User Experience that would be really appreciated ❤️
